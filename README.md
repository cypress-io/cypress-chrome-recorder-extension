Cypress extension for DevTools that allows you to export tests directly from the Recorder panel.

This extension allows you to quickly export recordings from Chrome DevTools Recorder as Cypress tests.

Once installed, a new export option will appear in the Recorder panel labeled "Export as a Cypress Test script". Click that and download the exported code as a file. Make sure to save the file with the extension `.cy.{ts,js)` if you are using Cypress >= 10.

This extension relies on the [cypress-chrome-recorder](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-chrome-recorder) library. Visit [its repo](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-chrome-recorder) for more information on export specifics.
